# Analysis-of-EEG-Signals-to-detect-Brain-Abnormalities-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
# Overview :
Neurological disorders pose significant challenges for timely diagnosis and treatment,
especially during seizures when rapid intervention is crucial. This project focuses on
leveraging deep learning models to rapidly detect brain abnormalities from EEG
(electroencephalogram) signals, providing efficient assistance to healthcare
professionals.

# Problem Statement:
During seizures, healthcare professionals must record EEG signals to monitor brain activity
and detect abnormalities. However, manually analyzing numerous EEG images is
time-consuming and delays critical interventions, risking patient health.

# Solution:
Our project offers an automated solution to expedite the detection of brain abnormalities
from EEG signals using deep learning models. By preprocessing the data with bandpass
filtering and extracting features through wavelet transformation, we enhance the efficiency of
EEG signal analysis. Additionally, we focus on the utilization of the cA (approximation)
coefficient obtained from wavelet transformation for its significant role in capturing essential
features indicative of brain abnormalities. The cA coefficients are used to form images,
providing a visual representation of the extracted features. These images serve as input to
our deep learning models for rapid analysis.

# Dataset:
We utilize EEG data sourced from Figshare, ensuring access to diverse and high-quality
datasets for training and evaluating our deep learning models.

# Implementation:
Preprocessing: EEG data undergoes bandpass filtering to remove noise, ensuring clean
input for our models.

# Feature Extraction: 
Wavelet transformation extracts relevant features from EEG signals,
capturing patterns indicative of brain abnormalities. We particularly focus on utilizing the cA
(approximation) coefficient obtained from wavelet transformation for its significant role in
capturing essential features.

# Image Formation: 
The cA coefficients are used to form images, providing a visual
representation of the extracted features. These images serve as input to our deep learning
models for rapid analysis.

# Training and Testing: 
We divide the dataset into training and testing sets to train our deep
learning models. The models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set
to assess their performance in detecting brain abnormalities from EEG signals.

# Conclusion:
This project showcases deep learning's efficacy in swiftly detecting brain abnormalities from
EEG signals, aiding healthcare professionals by automating analysis and prioritizing the cA
coefficient for timely interventions in neurological emergencies.
